I possess a deep-seated drive for taking charge and constantly developing my 𝗹𝗲𝗮𝗱𝗲𝗿𝘀𝗵𝗶𝗽 abilities. Whether it's organizing a trip with friends, hosting a party, being captain of the school badminton team, serving as a class representative, or leading a team at work, my natural inclination towards leadership enables me to confidently take charge and effectively manage people.

When I'm not immersing myself in data analysis, you can often find me clicking pictures, writing micro tales and poems, or reading. I also invest time in enhancing my knowledge of personal finance and the stock market, and I love exploring new places.
