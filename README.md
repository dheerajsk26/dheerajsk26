## Hi there 👋, my name is Dheeraj S Kulkarni
### Business Analyst
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#### About: 
"𝗤𝘂𝗲𝘀𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗺𝗮𝗿𝗸" — that's the nickname my mom gave me during my childhood because of my insatiable curiosity and constant questioning to feed my inquisitive mind. Growing up, I enhanced the skill of asking the right questions. 

Fast-forward → while working as a 𝗕𝘂𝘀𝗶𝗻𝗲𝘀𝘀 𝗔𝗻𝗮𝗹𝘆𝘀𝘁 𝗮𝘁 𝗧𝗖𝗦 for over two years, one of my main responsibilities was retrieving data through 𝗦𝗤𝗟 and effectively conveying 𝗶𝗻𝘀𝗶𝗴𝗵𝘁𝘀 to stakeholders. This experience served as a pivotal point where my passion for data truly blossomed and took hold.

Right questioning mindset, curious outlook & genuine interest towards data — these are the most crucial qualities of an analyst, and I found that this is exactly where my strengths lie. However, over the years, I have developed a passion not only for data but also for creating visually appealing data viz & 𝘀𝘁𝗼𝗿𝘆𝘁𝗲𝗹𝗹𝗶𝗻𝗴 with data. I don’t want to unfold the fact, but I am more than happy to jump in with both feet and work on data for free to cultivate my skills. 

I possess a deep-seated drive for taking charge and constantly developing my 𝗹𝗲𝗮𝗱𝗲𝗿𝘀𝗵𝗶𝗽 abilities. Whether it's organizing a trip with friends, hosting a party, being captain of the school badminton team, serving as a class representative, or leading a team at work, my natural inclination towards leadership enables me to confidently take charge and effectively manage people.

When I'm not immersing myself in data analysis — you can often find me either clicking pictures, writing micro tales, poems or reading. I also invest time in enhancing my knowledge of personal finance and the stock market, and I love exploring new places. 

Please feel free to contact me on LinkedIn or at dheerajsk26@gmail.com to discuss potential opportunities, photography or the stock market; we can get it done together!
