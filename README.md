## Hi there 👋, my name is Dheeraj S Kulkarni
### Data Analyst/Business Analyst
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#### About: 

"𝗤𝘂𝗲𝘀𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗺𝗮𝗿𝗸" — that's the nickname my mom gave me during my childhood because of my curiosity and constant questioning to feed my inquisitive mind. Growing up, I enhanced the skill of asking the 'right questions.' 

Fast-forward → While working as an 𝗔𝗻𝗮𝗹𝘆𝘀𝘁 𝗮𝘁 𝗧𝗖𝗦 for over two years, one of my main responsibilities was retrieving data through 𝗦𝗤𝗟 queries and effectively conveying 𝗶𝗻𝘀𝗶𝗴𝗵𝘁𝘀 to stakeholders. This experience served as a pivotal point where my passion for data truly blossomed and took hold.

Right questioning mindset, curious outlook & genuine interest towards data — these are the most crucial qualities of an analyst, and I found that this is exactly where my strengths lie. However, over the years, I have developed a passion not only for data but also for creating visually appealing 𝗱𝗮𝘁𝗮 𝘃𝗶𝘇 & 𝘀𝘁𝗼𝗿𝘆𝘁𝗲𝗹𝗹𝗶𝗻𝗴 with data. And, I'm an 𝗘𝘅𝗰𝗲𝗹 Enthusiast too ('Cell' promise😅)

I possess a deep-seated drive to take charge and constantly develop my 𝗹𝗲𝗮𝗱𝗲𝗿𝘀𝗵𝗶𝗽 abilities. Whether it's organizing a trip with friends, hosting a party, being captain of the school badminton team, serving as a class representative, or leading a team at work, my natural inclination towards leadership enables me to confidently take charge and effectively manage people.

When I'm not immersing myself in data analysis — you can often find me either clicking pictures, writing micro tales, poems or reading. I also invest time in enhancing my knowledge of personal finance and the stock market, and I love exploring new places. 

Please feel free to contact me here on LinkedIn or at 𝙙𝙝𝙚𝙚𝙧𝙖𝙟𝙨𝙠26@𝙜𝙢𝙖𝙞𝙡.𝙘𝙤𝙢 to discuss potential opportunities, photography or the stock market; we can get it done together!
